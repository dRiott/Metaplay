# Metaplay
Metaplay was conceived as a playlist sharing website, where several of your friends and family could build a playlist together.
With friends all over the world, it can be a joy to stay in touch by collaborating over music. This is Metaplay's core concept.

Metaplay began as a metadata collection, hence the prefix "Meta-", and later incorporating streaming to live up to its full name. Built almost entirely in Java, Metaplay uses Spring MVC, Spring Security, JPA, MySql, a AWS EC2 linux instance running Tomcat, and AWS S3 for pictures and audio. Frontend technologies include JSPs, jQuery, jQueryUI, and Bootstrap 3 CSS.

Beginning in September, everything from database to frontend was designed by David Riott. As a recent graduate from Denver-based
programming bootcamp Skill Distillery, David is actively on the job market and would love to hear from you. Shoot an email to david.riott1@gmail.com if you're interested in working together. Thanks for your interest in Metaplay!
